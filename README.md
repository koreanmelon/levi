## Quick Start

This repo was designed to run on Windows. However, it'll likely work on other operating systems as well as long as the OAK-D Lite camera is connected/linked properly.

It is recommended to use a virtual environment. To create a virtual environment, run the following command.

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate the virtual environment.

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install dependencies.

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the program, run the following command.

```powershell
python main.py
```

To deactivate the virtual environment, run the following command.

```powershell
deactivate
```
